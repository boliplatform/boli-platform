![Boli - Blockchain Tokenization Platform](https://via.placeholder.com/800x200?text=Boli+Tokenization+Platform)

Boli is a blockchain-based platform built on Algorand that enables the tokenization of real-world assets with a focus on unique locations and sustainable opportunities.

## üå¥ Overview

Boli empowers the tokenization of various real-world assets including:

- **Land & Property**: Real estate with integrated legal documentation
- **Blue Economy**: Sustainable marine resources and coastal ecosystems
- **Carbon Credits**: Verified carbon units for climate initiatives
- **Renewable Energy**: Clean energy infrastructure projects
- **Disaster Recovery**: Climate event-triggered financing instruments
- **Heritage Assets**: Cultural and historical preservation projects

The platform is built using Algorand blockchain technology to create transparent, secure, and fractionalizable tokenized assets.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Structure

This repository is organized as a monorepo with the following main components:

```
boli/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ boli-contracts/     # Algorand smart contracts for various asset types
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ boli-frontend/      # React-based web application
```

## üöÄ Setup

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v22.0 or later
- [AlgoKit CLI](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/algokit-cli#install) v2.0.0 or later
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for running an Algorand LocalNet (if developing locally)

### Initial Setup

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/boli.git
   cd boli
   ```

2. Bootstrap the project:
   ```bash
   algokit project bootstrap all
   ```
   This will install all dependencies for both the smart contracts and frontend.

3. Set up environment files:
   ```bash
   cd boli-contracts
   algokit generate env-file -a target_network localnet
   cd ..
   ```

4. Build the project:
   ```bash
   algokit project run build
   ```

### Starting the Development Environment

1. Start the Algorand LocalNet (in a separate terminal):
   ```bash
   algokit localnet start
   ```

2. Start the frontend development server:
   ```bash
   cd boli-frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

## üìù Contracts

The `boli-contracts` directory contains several Algorand smart contracts built with AlgoKit and TealScript, including:

- **Land & Property Contract**: Handles legal documentation, fractional ownership, and property tokenization
- **Blue Economy Contract**: Manages marine resources, fishing rights, and coastal tourism
- **Carbon Credits Contract**: Implements the Verified Carbon Unit Framework
- **Renewable Energy Contract**: Handles tokenization of energy projects
- **Disaster Recovery Contract**: Provides climate event-triggered financing
- **Heritage Asset Contract**: Manages cultural preservation tokenization
- **Compliance Contract**: Oversees regulatory compliance across all asset types

For more details, see the [boli-contracts README](./boli-contracts/README.md).

## üíª Frontend

The `boli-frontend` directory contains a React-based web application that provides a user interface for interacting with the Boli platform. Features include:

- Wallet integration with multiple Algorand wallets
- Asset browsing and filtering
- Investment functionalities
- Dashboard for tracking assets and investments
- Asset creation and management
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

For more details, see the [boli-frontend README](./boli-frontend/README.md).

## üîå Connecting to Algorand Networks

By default, the project is configured to run against Algorand LocalNet for development. To connect to TestNet or MainNet, modify the environment variables in the respective `.env` files.

### Frontend Network Configuration

In `boli-frontend/.env`, comment/uncomment the appropriate network settings:

```
# LocalNet
VITE_ALGOD_SERVER=http://localhost
VITE_ALGOD_PORT=4001
VITE_ALGOD_TOKEN=aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
VITE_ALGOD_NETWORK=localnet

# TestNet (uncomment to use)
# VITE_ALGOD_SERVER=https://testnet-api.algonode.cloud
# VITE_ALGOD_PORT=
# VITE_ALGOD_TOKEN=
# VITE_ALGOD_NETWORK=testnet
```

## üîê Algorand Wallet Integrations

The frontend includes support for multiple wallet providers:

- **LocalNet**: KMD/Local Wallet
- **TestNet/MainNet**:
  - Pera Wallet
  - Defly Wallet
  - Exodus Wallet

## üîÅ Development Workflow

1. Modify smart contracts in the `boli-contracts` directory
2. Compile contracts: `cd boli-contracts && algokit project run build`
3. Update frontend components in the `boli-frontend` directory
4. Run the development server: `cd boli-frontend && npm run dev`
5. Run tests: `algokit project run test`

## üß™ Testing

- **Smart Contracts**: Run unit tests with `cd boli-contracts && python -m pytest`
- **Frontend**: Run Jest tests with `cd boli-frontend && npm test`

## üèóÔ∏è Building for Production

To build the projects for production:

```bash
algokit project run build
```
